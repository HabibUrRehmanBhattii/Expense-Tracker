## About

In this app, I have used React useState. I have learnt how to use useState to add items to the list.I have also learnt how to use useState to filter items from the list. I have leared uplift the state to the parent component.  Working with React useState is very easy and fun. Events are also learnt in this app. The filter function is also learnt in this app. In this app filter function is used to filter the items from the list based on the year.
